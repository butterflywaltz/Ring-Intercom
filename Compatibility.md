# Compatibility
Conclusion first, **BPT YKP/200 should be compatible with Ring Intercom Video**

# Regarding intercom BPT YKP/200
BPT YKP/200 is a handset and wallmount unit, it has to be combined with a video unit, either YV (black and white), or YVC (colored). It is part of the BPT Lynea 200 family.  
Therefore it makes no sense to refer to YKP/200 alone, YKP/200 and YKP/200+YV(YVC) should mean the same unit, as illustrated in the [manual](manuals/BPT%20YKP200%20manual.pdf) (from doorentrydirect).

I have a YKP/200+YV (two labels, one is YKP/200 the other is YV)

# Support and forum community
Ring support didn't provide any useful insight despite photo uploaded to them. They keep telling me my intercom is not compatible.  
I also made a post on https://community-ring.sprinklr.com/en_GB/ ask for support, but not much insight either.  
In short, it's better for me to figure out on my own.  

# First clue from Amazon review  
This amazon review reveals the first clue, the image shown (after consulting ChatGPT) is a BPT Agata VC200.

By checking the [manual](manuals/BPT%20YKP200%20manual.pdf), I find almost exact wiring of this unit vs my YKP/200. This highly increase the chance of YKP/200 being compatible. (Left VC200, right YKP200, even the usage of 75ohm resistor is the same)

# Second clue from YKP/200's power supply unit VA/200
Within the BPT Lynea 200 family, YKP/200 usually connects to VA/200 PSU. By checking the VA/200 PSU, other video intercom terminals can be connected in the same way.
A [VA/200 manual](manuals/BPT%20VA200%20manual.pdf) from http://www.came-france.fr/ and a separate [manual](manuals/BPT%20VA200%20manual%20variation.pdf) from doorentrydirect shows the below models connects to VA/200 in exactly same manor:  
(by same manor, I mean terminal 3/4 for co-axial video, 5 common/ground, 6 power voltage, 7 call input, 8 audio to monitor, 9 audio to panel)  
YKP/200  
VM/200 (compatible)  
XV/200 (compatible)  
XC/200 (compatible)  
YVM/200 (compatible)  
Agata VC200 (compatible)

# Conclusion
I know almost for sure that my intercom is compatible.
