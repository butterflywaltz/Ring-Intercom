This one details the difference between analog system and digital system, which is pretty clear.

For Ring Intercom, C-1 to C-8 is for analog systems, and C-9 to C-12 is for digital systems. And analog systems indeed send signal by short circuiting terminals.  

So far I have not seen any mixed/hybrid systems. My intercom unlocks pedestrian door via analog way, and opens gate (which needs a digital signal) via a relay.
